# Twitter Hashtags Counter
A simple Angular 2 project that let you search for an hashtag on Twitter and count who and how many times used that hashtag


## Demo
Here's a [demo](https://twitterhashtagscounter.azurewebsites.net/) version of this application


## Deployment
You can download a pre-built version and follow the [Server-side setup](#server-side-setup) and deploy the package to your server.

Alternately you can build on your own following this [guide](Building).


## Get the source code
 - Create a folder
 - Enter that folder
 - Open a command prompt/bash 
 - Run <code>git clone https://github.com/l0ll098/TwitterHashtagsCounter.git</code>. This will clone this repo in your folder (you need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
 

## Server-side setup
 - Open the folder where you have downloaded the source code
 - Rename the file <code>config.template.js</code> to <code>config.js</code>
 - Open that file and replace the placeholder value with the keys generated by Twitter. You can find them in the [Application Management page](https://apps.twitter.com/) -> Navigate to your app (create a new one if don't already have one) -> Open the *"Keys and Access Tokens"* section
 - Save the file
